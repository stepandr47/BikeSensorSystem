# Bike Sensor System
School project completed in 2019.

Project Design:
⦁	Use two distance sensors, one on the front and the back of the skateboard, in order to detect objects at a distance less than or equal to 400cm. 
⦁	When the device is first turned on there is a user setup mode. The setup mode allows the user to set the distances that they want the LEDs and sound to be activated at. The minimum distance that can be used is 3cm and the maximum distance 400cm. 
⦁	The rear-facing sensor will be set by the user to have three proximity thresholds. Each set range will have a different LED turn on to indicate how close objects behind the user are. 
⦁	The forward-facing sensor will be set by the user to have two proximity thresholds. Each proximity threshold will have a different beep frequency. This will be used for when a pedestrian gets too close to the front of your board to warn them that you are there.
